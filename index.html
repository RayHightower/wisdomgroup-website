    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>Steve Jobs said it best: &#8220;Design is not just what [a product] looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.&#8221; A well-designed commerce app will make it easy for the customer to buy. Our apps use design to solve problems and generate revenue. Let's put those skills to work for you.</p>

        <p>Sometimes hiring a software developer is overkill. As a business leader, you have goals to achieve in a limited amount of time. Will a web or mobile app really make money for your company? Or should you focus your attention elsewhere?</p>
